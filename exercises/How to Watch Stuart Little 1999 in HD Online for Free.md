Stuart Little (1999) is not only a movie about a mouse, but also a movie about family, friendship, and belonging. Stuart is adopted by the Littles, a kind and loving couple who already have a son named George. Stuart tries to fit in with his new family and make friends at school, but he faces many challenges and dangers because of his size and species. He also has to deal with Snowbell, the family cat who is jealous of him and plots to get rid of him with the help of some alley cats.
 
The movie is based on the classic children's book by E.B. White, but it makes some changes and additions to the story. For example, in the book, Stuart is born as a mouse to human parents, while in the movie, he is adopted from an orphanage. The movie also introduces some new characters, such as Margalo, a bird who becomes Stuart's friend and love interest, and Falcon, a villainous bird who kidnaps Margalo. The movie also has more action and comedy scenes than the book, such as the boat race, the roadster chase, and the washing machine mishap.
 
The movie is praised for its visual effects and voice acting. Stuart is created with computer-generated imagery (CGI) that makes him look realistic and expressive. He interacts seamlessly with the live-action actors and settings. Michael J. Fox lends his voice to Stuart and gives him a warm and witty personality. Other voice actors include Nathan Lane as Snowbell, Melanie Griffith as Margalo, James Woods as Falcon, and Steve Zahn as Monty, a dim-witted mouse who helps Snowbell.
 
However, the movie is also criticized for its plot and tone. Some critics argue that the movie is too simplistic and predictable, and that it does not explore the deeper themes and emotions of the book. They also complain that the movie is too sentimental and saccharine, and that it does not capture the whimsy and charm of White's writing. Some critics also find the movie disturbing and depressing, as they feel sorry for Stuart's plight and fear for his safety.
